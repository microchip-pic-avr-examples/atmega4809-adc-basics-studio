# ATMEGA4809 Xplained Pro ADC basics

MegaAVRÂ® 0-series devices feature a 10-bit successive approximation register (SAR) Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and is capable of conversion rates up to 115 ksps. It features a flexible multiplexer, which allows the ADC to measure the voltage at multiplesingle-ended input pins.

There are four modes we will explore in this example:
*  ADC Free-Running mode
*  ADC Single Conversion mode
*  ADC Window Comparator mode
*  ADC Sample Accumulator mode

This is an example of how to get started with the ADC on the ATMEGA4809. This is based on the application note [AN2573](#Related-Documentation).

## Hardware Used

- [ATmega4809 Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMEGA4809-XPRO)

## Setup

* Port `PD6` is the ADC channel input, connect a cable here to interract with the ADC.

## Operation

1. Open `ADCBasicswithmegaAVR0-Series.atsln` in Atmel Studio
2. Connect the ATmega4809 Xplained Pro to your computer with a micro usb cable.
3. In your menu bar in Atmel Studio go to `Debug->Start Without Debugging` or press `CTRL + ALT + F5`
4. Open your favorite terminal application or Data visualizer and open the serial port associated with the Xplained Pro.

As mentioned in the appnote [AN2573](#Related-Documentation) you can change the voltage level of the adc input port and the approximated value will be shown over UART through data visualizer.
## Conclusion

We here shown how to setup and get started with the ADC basics project. For more details about this example and how the ADC works please see the [AN2573](#Related-Documentation) Application Note.
